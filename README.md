# Travis
Travis is a **work in progress** voice controlled home assistant with some basic features. It is built with the Artyom.js voice control library: https://sdkcarlos.github.io/sites/artyom.html

There's no current plans for Travis, I just expand it as I see fit, usually when I get new ideas/tech that has some kind of API.

Current features:
* Spotify
  * Sign in with Spotify OAuth to obtain access token
  * Control Spotify playback
* Plex.tv
  * Sign in with Plex.tv PIN to obtain access token
  * Control Plex.tv playback (Still work in progress)
* Pushbullet
  * Sign in with Pushbullet OAuth to obtain access token
  * Send notifications to devices through Pushbullet (Still in early stages)
* Miscellaneous commands
  * Tell jokes through https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ API
  * Look up definitions through https://www.urbandictionary.com/ API
  * Tell which day and month it is
